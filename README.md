## 🌍 Food Emission Analysis Project
## 📌 Problem Statement

📌 Overview

This project analyzes the environmental impact of different food products, focusing on:

* Carbon emissions

* Land use

* Water use

* Eutrophication (water pollution)

The aim is to highlight sustainable food choices and provide actionable insights that can guide consumers, policymakers, and organizations in reducing environmental footprints.

## 🔍 Business Questions

1. Which food products have the highest and lowest carbon emissions?
2. How do Plant-Based vs. Animal-Based foods compare in environmental impact?
3. Which food production stage contributes most to Emissions?
4. How do different food types impact the environment?
5. What are the top five contributors to Eutrophication?
6. Do we have cluster of group of foods based on their environmental impact?
7. What is the environmental impact by cluster?
8. What is the environmental impact by Category (Plant Based and Animal Based)
9. What are the Environmental factors across Category?

## 📊 Key Insights

* Beef is the most carbon-intensive food – Beef (beef herd) has nearly 3× the emissions of lamb & mutton.

* Plant-based foods are more sustainable – Nuts, potatoes, onions, root vegetables, and citrus emit <1% of beef’s emissions.

* Dairy & processed foods also rank high – Cheese and dark chocolate have disproportionately high impacts.

* Animal-based foods dominate eutrophication – Beef, fish, and cheese are top contributors to water pollution.

* Farm stage is the largest emitter – Followed by land-use change and animal feed production.

## Recommendations

* Encourage clients and stakeholders to reduce beef and dairy consumption, as these are the highest contributors to carbon emissions and eutrophication.

* Work with farmers to optimize farm emissions, since the farm stage contributes most to emissions.
  
* Support companies in adopting sustainable packaging and transport methods to cut down secondary emissions.

* Run awareness campaigns to show the environmental footprint of different food types, helping consumers make informed choices.

* Target interventions on high-emission and high-land-use clusters (e.g., beef, lamb, dairy) for maximum environmental benefit.
